# GhostKitchen

CSE 248 final assigment

This project was a mark up of a ghost kitchen service similar to ubereats and grubhub. The project uses a Spring boot back end along with Html/Css/React. It also utalizes a psql database.
This was my first time working with databases and front end languages, although not perfect it was very enjoyable. In the future I hope to deploy the project with either docker or heroku.
